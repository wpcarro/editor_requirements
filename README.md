# Checklist

This is for personal use only.

Below is a checklist I reference when configuring an editor for a new language.

## Jump to definition
* Jump to definition for my project's source code
* Jump to definition for the language's source code
* Jump to definition for third-party packages' source code

## Documentation
* View my project's documentation
* View the language's documentation
* View third-party packages' documentation

## Autocomplete
* Autocomplete for my project
* Autocomplete for the language I'm using
* Autocomplete for third-party packages

## Conditional
These features depend on the language supporting them. For example, not all
languages have REPLs.
* Format source code on file save
* Flycheck for linting
* REPL access

## Non-negotiables
* Up-to-date syntax highlighting
* Find or create test files for a given module
* Snippets for function definitions, variable definitions, conditionals,
  imports, etc.

## Nice-to-haves
* Vim text objects for things like: function definitions, comment blocks, etc.
* Find usages via xref
